# create-react-app + typescript + workerize-loader

A minimal exapmple using [`workerize-loader`](https://github.com/developit/workerize-loader) to load webworkers with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and
typescript **without ejecting the app**.  Special thanks to [these](https://github.com/developit/workerize-loader/issues/5#issuecomment-357239203) [comments](https://github.com/developit/workerize-loader/issues/3#issuecomment-538730979).
